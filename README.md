## **Arihant_CVI_task_2.ipynb**

In this jupyter notebook I have used VGG16 deep learning architecture to classify images into 6 catogories
for this purpose, I have used transfer learning and used last 2 layers of pretrained model to train on training data of about 8000 images. I have got training accuracy about 93% and test accuracy of about 62%.
